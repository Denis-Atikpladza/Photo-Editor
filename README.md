# About

A small Python project that focuses on photo manipulation. I have created some filters that are similar to the 
ones that are displayed on snapchat or your phone's filters.

# How to Run
This is compatable with any IDE that uses python 3

Download the project and (ensure all files are in the same folder) and run the photo editor.
A prompt will appear with options on the console (It is caps sensative) enter your command
and then press the enter key

1. load an image: press L, a file selection will pop up and which you can select a .jpg file to edit

ex.
Enter a command from the following options:
Type L: to Load image
Type N: for Negative  G: for Grayscale  X: for extreme contrast  S: for Sepia tint  E: for Edge detect
Type Q: to quit

L

2.Edit an image: press one of the filter commands. The photo will be edited and displayed when completed
(some filters take longer than others)

ex.
Enter a command from the following options:
Type L: to Load image
Type N: for Negative  G: for Grayscale  X: for extreme contrast  S: for Sepia tint  E: for Edge detect
